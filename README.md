## Diana PHP Framework

There are plenty of frameworks to choose out there, so which one to go for?
Or should you rather use plain PHP for the next project, because of all of that unnecessary bloat you don't even need?
With that in mind, I have been starting to develop Diana, a modular, simple to use, yet powerful framework. Diana aims to be the perfect choice for every project, because you just include the parts you need for your specific app, leaving out all of the bloat that you don't need.

The target group of Diana are developers loving simplicity and easy-to-understand code. Diana will offer many pre-built packages which you are free to use, but you can always decide to extend those or even write your own packages if you wish to do so, integrating every possible existing library. This freedom of choosing and the variety of packages provides a whole new set of possibilities.

## Official Documentation

A full documentation of the framework will be available at a future time.

## Errors and Bugs

If you find any bugs or errors, please report them on the official forums that will be available at a future time.
Feel free to also send an e-mail to an email address, that will be provided at a future time. Please keep in mind that the Diana framework is still in development and can contain errors. I try to do my best to fix them in time. 

Also, please report any security vulnerability to the given address.
